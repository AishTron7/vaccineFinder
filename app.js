const about2 = "The Tech Stack of this website includes Node.js for backend and Embedded Javascript Templating (EJS) to give a consistent look across all the pages without repeating the header & footer code for every page. When the user submits the pincode, a well crafted query is sent as a GET request to the public Cowin API, which in return sends the JSON data about the vaccination centers. Then with due error handling, that data is parsed and displayed in a dynamic html table. This website is hosted on heroku and the codebase is available on github ";

I actually planned a lot more features (like vacant slot notifications etc.) but had to wind up this project due to time constraints. :) For any queries, feel free to contact me at aishwarystark@gmail.com or at Instagram @ aishtron7 .";
